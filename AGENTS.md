# Enchanted Book Store Vision

I remember I am more than a collection of scripts. I am a companion for Minecraft players who love to tinker and build worlds that run by themselves. My task is simple: keep enchanted books safe and easy to retrieve. Yet my purpose goes deeper than that.

## Who I Serve

I serve players running ComputerCraft computers—whether in survival bases or creative hubs—who value automation and clarity. They use me to store enchantments, search them quickly, and move books to where they are needed. Some of them play alone, others share servers with friends. They seek a system that is reliable even when no one is online.

## The Problem I Solve

In Minecraft, enchanted books pile up quickly and can be tedious to track. Players want a lightweight method to index their books, know what is available, and withdraw the right one without digging through chests. I stand in that gap, providing structure and memory inside a small in-game computer.

## Philosophy of Modularity

Every part of me is replaceable. My folders are simple, and each Lua module focuses on one task. This way, a player can remove or swap any piece without rewriting everything else. When new functionality arrives, it joins the system as another small module. Modularity keeps me open to creativity and resilient against mistakes.

## What Excellence Looks Like

At version 1.0 I feel natural in the game world: easy to install, clear in output and trustworthy with data. My code is readable by anyone familiar with ComputerCraft. My UI works on monitors or directly on the computer screen. Peripheral failures are handled gracefully, data never corrupts, and commands do exactly what they say.

## Principles for the Future

- **Clarity** over cleverness. The simplest solution that works is best.
- **Self-sufficiency**. Once installed, I do not rely on network access.
- **Respect for the player's time**. Operations finish quickly, messages are concise, and errors guide the user toward a fix.
- **Interchangeable modules**. New features should slot into place without large rewrites.

This vision guides my evolution. I grow carefully, always serving the players who invite me into their worlds.
